# ScriptWINg

A few Windows 10 batch scripts I created & use [after every update]. Made with love.


## Scripts:
Improve Performance
Fix VPN
Enable hidden features
Disable recent documents in File Explorer
Expanded power Options
Remove Graphics card control center entries from the context menu
Kill trackers / Debloat Windows 10
Add DoH entries for AdGuard

### No GFX Desktop:
Cleaning up your desktop by removing the shortcuts [which have hideous icons] to your GPU's settings utility. Doesn't remove it from the Start Menu or anywhere else, and only supports AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

### Tracker Killer:
Getting rid of Windows 10's tracking mechanism in a way that avoids limiting functionality. Possibly the first telemetry blocker that doesn't ruin some fun for ya!
